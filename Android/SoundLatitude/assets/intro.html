<b><a href="http://bearing.googlecode.com">Bearing</a></b>
is a simple application that remembers one GPS location and then computes
the bearing and distance between that specific location and your current
GPS location.
<br/>
It's also displays the current compass value.
<p/>
That's all there is, really.
<p/>
<b>What is this good for?</b> I use it for land survey: walk to a particular
point, mark the GPS location and then walk towards the next point and
note the bearing and distance between the two points. There are some
caveats when doing so, mostly GPS accuracy and update interval, but
it's a good start.
<p/>
<b>What this is not?</b> This is not a game.
There are no fancy graphics, not even a graphical display of the
compass. There are just a bunch of techy numbers and some cryptic
text display.
<p/>

The various text fields displayed are as follow:
<p/>
<b>Mark Location</b>:
    <ul>
    <li>GPS coordinates of the marked location,</li>
    <li>Bearing to current location in degrees,</li>
    <li>Distance to current location in feet.</li>
    </ul>
<b>Current location</b>:
    <ul>
    <li>GPS coordinates,</li>
    <li>GPS accuracy (meters and feet),</li>
    <li>GPS bearing and GPS speed (only useful if you're moving at more than 5 mph).</li>
    <li>It also displays two time delays: the numbers of seconds elapsed since the
    last GPS coordinate update and the numbers of seconds for the previous update.
    This is enough to give you an idea of how often the GPS updates and thus if
    the value is stale or fresh.</li>
    </ul>
<b>Compass</b>:
    <ul>
    <li>Heading in degrees,</li>
    <li>Average of the last 20 samples,</li>
    <li>Accuracy (high, medium, low).</li>
    </ul>
<b>GPS status</b>: started vs stopped, last fix time stamp, number of satellites.

<p/>
There are two buttons on the screen:
<ul>
<li>The <b>Mark Loc</b>ation button lets you mark the current GPS location.
The location is saved in permanent storage and will be recalled when the app
is next started (useful if your phone looses its battery or such.)
</li>
<li>The <b>Compass</b> button launches the <em>GPS Status</em> application.
This is a 3rd-party application available on Market. It must be installed for
this feature to work.
Follow this <a href="market://search?q=pname:com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2">link to
GPS Status on Market</a> to install it.
</li>
</ul>
